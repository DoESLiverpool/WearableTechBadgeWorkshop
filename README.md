This first step develops the basics of a pressure sensor; we can refer to more complex and accurate sensors and reflect on their usage.

 * Follow the [WDHLL pressure sensor build](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/what-does-health-look-like/tree/master/pressure-sensor)
 * Decide on where and how to wear it and connect it the badge

### Session 2
Connect Microbit and sensor to P5.js and experiment with code

![Skill Covered](https://img.shields.io/badge/skill-electronics-green.svg?longCache=true&style=plastic)

Here we use [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to learn basic principles of how to manipulate analog sensor data with code, in this case.


 Both these platforms have noob friendly  Browser based IDE's to play with in the form of [Microbit](https://microbit.org/code/) and [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org) to save the hassle of installing arduino or python environments, but we can sign post to these easily if participants are interested.

 * We will borrow the microbits from Laura's [What DoES Health Look Like (WDHLL)](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/what-does-health-look-like/) to learn and experience coding for data visualisation.
 * We'll start with an introduction to Mircobits as it's a good way in to code for newcomers.
 * We'll introduce peope to P5.js, a javascript implementation of the popular Processing programming language.
  * Use [jackie1050's & zarinos test openprocessing sketches](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/139031) and experiment with P5.js.

3. **Session 3** Make a bio-illuminator, a 'viewing platform'/sharpie friendly writable space for displaying your name and viewing microorganisms on the DoES Microscope and Foldscopes

![Skill Covered](https://img.shields.io/badge/skill-electonics-green.svg?longCache=true&style=plastic)

Here the 3 of us were interested in exploring physical computing in counterpoint to the previous workshops software layers. We are often frustrated with having to use code to do simple routing or logic that could easily be done with electronic components. Programming with components means you really understand what components do and how they scale up into Integrated circuits and gives a more intimate understanding of the tech we use.

 * We'll use 4 LEDs and a circuit of `555` Timer chips, diodes, logic gates and adjustable [DIP switches](https://uk.farnell.com/w/c/switches-relays/switches/dip-switches-sip-switches/prl/results?st=multi%20position%20switch) to programme a sequence of LED illumination to make attractive 'glyph' patterns for our ID badges, responding to the pressure sensor input and under the right conditions 'control' light sensitive algae, *Eugelena gracilis* on a small fabric or PCB clear fibreglass viewing 'platform' compatible with a standard microscope slide, the [DoES Workshop Microscope](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/Microscope) and a [Foldscope](https://www.foldscope.com/) which comes included with the workshop kit (@cheapjack can source these at cost of £2.80 each)
 * This [555 Timer Learning Site](http://www.555-timer-circuits.com/) is essential reading for us and a good resource to share.

4. **Session 4** Make our bio-illuminator wearable and test with our algae friends

![Skill Covered](https://img.shields.io/badge/skill-sewing-orange.svg?longCache=true&style=plastic)
![Skill Covered](https://img.shields.io/badge/skill-microscopy-black.svg?longCache=true&style=plastic)

Finally we assemble everything using a textile pocket to enclose electronics and the viewing platform/writeable surface for wrting your name/twitter handle whatever. We then include a simple safety pin holder and work out ways to route sensors into clothing etc, referring to other DoES community activity like the collaboration with Brouhaha dancers for the LED drum wearables, Netball opening ceremony etc.

 * Enclose the `555` & `DIP` switch illumination circuit in a customisable fabric template
 * Test it as a bio-illuminator
 * Make sure it also works as a name badge when no organisms are available. As our algae are only 100 nm long they can easily live between the writing that is done on the writable microscope slide (ie so you can wear the badge and write your name on it). It's a name badge so it's inherently sociable in the right context. Conversations can include or exclude microbiological critters depending on context.
 * We can also look in detail under the microscope at the physical nature of the components, and potentially make PDMS microfluidic moulds from the markings and micro structures of the components and textile materials.

Here we use well known platforms with extended communities of practice ie. an active community sharing tutorials and code beyond our won, to explore basic principles of how to manipulate analog sensor data with code, in this case javascript via the block --> javascript friendly microbit platform and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
